# database-project

This project is intended help me practice using a database, and is a simplified model to help healthcare providers determine if a patient is eligible/missed any vaccinations based on their current age and immunization history. 

This project uses a virtual environment, so be sure to activate the virtual environment first before running the program (or just install the pip packages needed, there aren't many). 

Run python3 project.py within the directory, and the GUI will begin!
